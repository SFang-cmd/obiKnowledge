2 Reasons to build Robots:
- Do specialized tasks
- Observe them to learn about animal mechanics

Definitions:
- Robotics is the science of perceiving and manipulating the physical world through computer-controlled mechanical devices
- **Perception:** Concept of running your sensors and understanding what constitutes your environment
- **Learning:** Understanding what the environment needs from our agent; how do I get the outputs from perception to make decisions in control?
- **Control:** How the agent interacts with the world
