**Graph** - way of representing *relationships* between *pairs of objects*
- Objects are **nodes/vertices**
- Relationships are **edges**
**Adjacent:** 2 vertices $u,v$ are adjacent if there is an edge between them
**Incident:** an edge is incident on a vertex if that vertex is one of the end points
