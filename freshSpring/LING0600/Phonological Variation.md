- Differences in which **distinctive** sounds are used in a word
	- Difference in the categories of vowels
	- i.e. There are different [[lexical sets]] available
- If people in your group are disagreeing about lexical sets, that's an example of phonological variation!
- Phonological variation can also be about a single speaker using different pronunciations of the same word - like working vs workin'
