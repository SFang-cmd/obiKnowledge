- Subtle, gradient differences in the way a particular speech sound is pronounced in a word
	- Same categories and [[lexical sets]], just in slight variations of each other
	- Tongue does not always land in the same place
- Phonetic variation is by definition **gradient** - there is a continuum of possible sounds involved
- We quantify phonetic variation along some continuous numeric scale, such as the use of Hz for vowel formant measurements
- The [[Vowel]] space is **gradient** - there is a continuum of possible [[Vowel]] sounds in every direction
- So, vowels are a rich territory for phonetic variation
