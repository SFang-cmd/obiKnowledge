Since the GS algorithm always outputs S*, does this mean that there is only one output for the GS algorithm no matter what order the people start in?

The GS algorithm always outputs S*, but are there other stable matchings that do not pair people with the best possible pets? (I guess so because if we ran the GS algorithm backwards, it would favor the pets, which would result in worst possible for people, so its still a stable matching, but it would find the best for pets and worst for people)

If the GS algorithm outputs the same output back and forth, then there is only one possible best valid parter
