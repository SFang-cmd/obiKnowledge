**Structure of Matter:**
1. Elementary Particles
	- baryons - (Protons (+, $m_{p} = 1.67 \times 10^{-27}$) + Neutrons (neutral, $m_{n} = m_{p}$))
	- leptons - (Electrons (-, $m_{e} = 9.11 \times 10^{-31}$))
	- Models of the atom:
		- Rutherford - Classical (doesn't make sense since electron loses energy) - Quantum (electrons are waves that have a probability to be in any location)

**Macroscopic objects:**
When we make visible objects, there are two classes of atoms:
*Insulators* - closely bound electrons, but not being able to leave the particle (strong electromagnetic attraction)
*Conductors/Metals* - inner layer of electrons repels outer layer, making them more susceptible to leaving the atom, accumulation of positive and negative charges globally

**Important:** *Total charge is conserved* - You can take a charge somewhere and move it somewhere else, but you cannot just take one

**Unit of Charge:**
Coulomb [C]
-->$e = 1.60 \times 10^{-15}C$ (equals charge of single electron)
	Electron has charge $-e$

Force between charges: Coulomb's Law

Given two charges, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ at a distance $r$, there will be a force of equal magnitude in opposite directions:
					$r$
$F$ <-- $Q_1$ ------------$Q_2$ --> $F$

$F=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}}\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r^2}$ --> $Q > 0$ positive charges
						$Q < 0$ negative charges (e.g. electrons)
\*We are assuming that $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are positive, so they repel each other when positive

Given $Q_{1}= +5C$, $Q_{2}=-3C$, $r=1.5m$, 
$F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{(5C)(-3C)}{(1.5m)^{2}} < 0$, so the forces attract towards each other

**Forces are additive:**
Thus, choose a coordinate system that makes addition easy
If negative sign, then points towards each other

**Vectorial Form of Coulomb's Law:**
$F=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r^2}$
$\vec{F}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{|\vec{r}|^2}\hat{r}$
promotes the **distance,** $r$ between the two, since it directs one toward or away from the other

The $\hat{r}=\frac{\vec{r}}{|\vec{r}|}$ is a unit vector
Tells us about the force on $Q_2$ if looking at the distance from charge 1 to charge 2
$Q_1$ to $Q_2$
