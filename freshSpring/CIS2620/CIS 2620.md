**Theory of Computation:**
Understand the mathematical undertones of computer science

Hilbert - is there a systematic procedure that will give you a solution or no?
- Exists IF you are trying to look for solutions in complex numbers
- Instead of asking for solutions of a complex number, you can use real numbers
- Is there a solution in rational numbers?

$x^2=2$
- Solution in real numbers, but not rational

[[Alphabet]] can be seen as the input and output of an algorithm
Related to linguists! (Influential work done by Chompsky, a linguist)

You do not gain or lose significantly if you look at it one bit at a time, but instead
on the other hand, if you are looking at the decision outputs, you get rid of the output details (always 0 and 1)

We focus on the decision problems since this will preserve the complexity and difficulty of the problem without worrying about whether the output is 1 bit, or 10 bits, etc. Think about the output as $0,1$.

We will be getting rid of all details and simply focusing on the decision problems over binary bits

**Motivation:** How can we solve problems
