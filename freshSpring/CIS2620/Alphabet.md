**Alphabet:** A finite non-empty subset of symbols; we denote the "alphabet" as $\Sigma$
(In which we will represent our input)
Eg. $\Sigma = \{0,1\}, \Sigma = \{a,b\}, \Sigma = \{a,b,c\}$

Def'n:
	For any alphabet $\Sigma$, $\Sigma^*$ denotes the set of strings over the alphabet $\Sigma$
	(There are infinitely many of these, since the strings can be infinitely long)
	Then, $\Sigma^k$ denotes the set of strings of length k. $\Sigma^*=\cup_{k \geq 0}\Sigma^{k}$
