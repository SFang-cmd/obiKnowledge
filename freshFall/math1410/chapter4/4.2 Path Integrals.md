We are interested in the cumulative amount of "stuff" along a path in the plane.

For a function $f(x,y)$ and a path in the plane,
***Path Integral:**
$\int_{path}{f}dl =$ Area of a "curvy" wall*

Keep in mind: $dl$ is the arc length element, meaning we slowly move through the path little by little

Well, how do you compute a path integral?
- You need to parametrize the path! **(Use $\gamma(t)$)**

**Path Integral (Expanded):**
$\int_{path = \gamma}{f}dl = \int_{t=a}^{t=b}{f(\gamma(t))|{\frac{d\gamma}{dt}|}}dt$
$= \int{f(x(t),y(t))|d\gamma|}$
