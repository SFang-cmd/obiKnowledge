For a vector field,
$\vec{F} = F_{x}i + F_{y}j$

Green's theorem:
$\int_{\delta D}F_{x}dx + F_{y}dy = \int\int_{D}\frac{\delta F_{y}}{\delta x} - \frac{\delta F_{x}}{\delta y} dA$ ("Circulation" version)
$\int_{\delta D}F_{x}dy + F_{y}dx = \int\int_{D}\frac{\delta F_{x}}{\delta x} - \frac{\delta F_{y}}{\delta y} dA$ ("Flux" version)
These densities are two different types of "derivatives of vector fields"

**Curl**
$\frac{\delta F_{y}}{\delta x} - \frac{\delta F_{x}}{\delta y}$ 
$\nabla \times \vec{F}$
-> This is called the **curl**, where at each point, it asks how much counterclockwise (>0) spin the vector field exhibits infinitesimally: It's a limiting intensity of circulation

*Direction of logic:* For a CCW spin, for the change in magnitude of the field in the y direction, $\delta F_{y}$, this value needs to be increasing as x increases. For $\delta F_{x}$, this value needs to continually decrease as y increases:

Notice how the $F_{x}$ decreases the more $y$ goes up, while $F_{y}$ increases the more $x$ goes up

**Divergence**
$\frac{\delta F_{x}}{\delta x} + \frac{\delta F_{y}}{\delta y}$ 
$\nabla \cdot \vec{F}$
-> This is called the **divergence**, where at each point, this tells you how much expansion (>0) or contraction (<0) the field exhibits infinitesimally: It's a limiting intensity of flux

*Direction of Logic:* This one is much easier to understand, since its basically just how much more "stuff" leaves the figure that comes into the figure at different locations

**Green's Theorem Rewritten**
**Theorem:** For $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ A domain with oriented boundary $\delta D$,
$\int_{\delta D}F_{x}dx + F_{y}dy = \int\int_{D}(\nabla \times \vec{F}) dA$ (Vector "Circulation" version)
$\int_{\delta D}F_{x}dy + F_{y}dx = \int\int_{D}(\nabla \cdot \vec{F})dA$ (Vector "Flux" Version)

Can think of as infinitely many curls or flux points, where each dot cancels each other out, but the exterior on the boundary is the only thing we care about

**3D Divergence:**
$\nabla \cdot \vec{F} = \frac{\delta F_{x}}{\delta x} + \frac{\delta F_{y}}{\delta y} + \frac{\delta F_{z}}{\delta z}$
Another way to think about it:
$\frac{dV}{V}|_{t=0}= \nabla \cdot \vec{F}$
In general, the divergence at a point indicates the local expansion (positive) or contraction (negative) of the volume element there.

*Why does this work?*

**3D Curl:**
$\nabla \times \vec{F} = (\frac{\delta F_{z}}{\delta y} - \frac{\delta F_{y}}{\delta z})i + (\frac{\delta F_{x}}{\delta z} - \frac{\delta f_{z}}{\delta x})j + (\frac{\delta F_{y}}{\delta x} - (\frac{\delta F_{x}}{\delta y})k$
The Curl is NOT a scalar field, so must use vectors
The Curl of a 3D Vector Field is another vector field that measures rotation. It measures the magnitude and direction of a local rotation of the field. 

*Think this way:* The different vector directions inducing spin on a point will eventually cancel into a common direction of spin, like an x and z axis spin will cause the resulting curl to be a mix of both, depending on varying magnitudes, so this makes sense

**Note:** Very similar to the cross product of two vectors:
$\nabla \times \vec{F}$
$= DET \begin{vmatrix}   i & \frac{\delta}{\delta x} & F_{x}\\   j & \frac{\delta}{\delta y} & F_{y}\\ k & \frac{\delta}{\delta z} & F_{z}  \end{vmatrix}$
