**Thm:** For a Vector Field $\vec{F} = P(x,y)\bar{i} + Q(x,y)\bar{j}$,
The circulation along the boundary of a path D is given by:
$\int_{\delta{D}}{P{dx} + Q{dy} = \int\int_{D}{\frac{\delta{Q}}{\delta{x}}-\frac{\delta{P}}{\delta{y}}}dA}$

**Big Idea:** The *integral of a 1-Form* over the *boundary of a domain* in the plane is equal to the *integral* of a *certain derivative* over the domain interior

**Special Note: Orientation MATTERS!! Walk CCW (aka left arm should point into the domain)**

With multiple bodies, can imagine a bunch of CCW spinners that orient the object, so holes might be spinning CW, but its only because of left arm still points into boundary

(The derivation relies on the fact that the right-hand side has two integrals and a derivative, which almost "cancel out" to create only the one path integral on the left-hand side)

**Intuition:**
Consider the [[path integral]] of $\alpha = xdy$ over a planar rectangle and a planar circle, given by the parameterization $\gamma$:

**So the area of the shapes is equivalent to the line integral of its boundary, hmmmmm**



**Special Note II: 1-Forms must be Differentiable over the Domain's Entire Interior!!**

Above does not work because the 1-Form is not differentiable at (0,0)
However,

Proof of Green's Theorem:

Key notes:
- You're basically using the FTIC to take an integral of a derivative to ensure that the integral is calculated correctly back to a single integral
- With the proof of a rectangle, conceptually you can just paste infinitely many rectangles in any shape and Green's Theorem will hold true on only the outer edge of the shape because all of the inner edges get cancelled out.
