Consider a (nice) subset, $D \subset R^2$ in the $(x,y)$ plane

Def:
$\int_{D}f(x,y)dx \land dy = \int\int_{D}f(x,y)dA$

For a pair of vectors, $u$ and $v$, the basis 2-form gives
$(dx \land dy)(u,v) = DET[u | v] = \text{"Area"}$

Recall from last chapter...
$dx \land dy = -dy \land dx$
2-Forms (Like 1-forms) have orientation data baked into the ordering of the terms, so the Basis 2-form in the plane is the Area Form with orientation

In the plane, a 2-Form is really a "weighted" area form & can be integrated.
