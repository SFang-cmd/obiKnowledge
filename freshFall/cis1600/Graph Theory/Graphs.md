A graph is a representation of a set of vertices, $V$ connected by the set of edges $E$ using the representation $G = (V,E)$

Not all graphs must have edges, but graphs must have at least one vertex.

**Edge:** Given two vertices, $u$ and $v$, and edge connects the two vertices $\{u,v\} \in E$.
**Adjacent:** if $\{u,v\} \in E$, then $u$ and $v$ are adjacent
**Neighbor:** The set of nodes adjacent to $u$ are called the neighbors of $u$
**Degree:** The number of neighbors to $u$ is known as $deg(u)$
**Minimum Degree:** The minimum degree, $\delta (G)$ is the smallest degree of a single vertex in the graph. In other words, the minimum degree is the smallest number of neighbors a vertex in graph G has
**Maximum Degree:** The maximum degree, $\Delta (G)$ is the largest degree of a single vertex, which means it is the largest number of neighbors a single vertex in graph G has.

**Loop:** An edge that connects a node to itself
**Parallel edges:** Multiple edges connecting the same two vertices
**Simple Graphs:** graphs without loops and parallel edges
**Multigraphs**: All other graphs (including loops and parallel edges)
