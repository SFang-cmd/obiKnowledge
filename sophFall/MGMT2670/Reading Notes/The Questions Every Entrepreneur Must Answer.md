Unlike big business questions:
- What business **are** we in?
- How can we exploit our core competencies?
Entrepreneurs need to ask:
- What business do we **want** to be in?
- What capabilities would we **like** to develop?

Young Enterprises Lack:
- Coherent Strategies
- Competitive Strengths
- Talented Employees
- Adequate Controls
- Clear Reporting Relationships

**It is important to distinguish critical issues from normal growing pains**

Goals:
- Help entrepreneurs analyze situations.
- Establish priorities among opportunities and problems.
- Make rational decisions about the future.

Framework:
1. Clarify an entrepreneur's current goals
2. Evaluate their strategies for attaining these goals
3. Assess their capacity to execute their strategies.

**Clarifying Goals: Where Do I Want to Go?**
- What do you want personally from your business?
- The kind of enterprise required?
- Your risk tolerance

**How Will I Get There?**
- Successful Strategies:
	- Provide clear direction: Articulate the enterprise's policies, geographic reach, capabilities, and decision-making framework - in concise terms that employees, investors, and customers can understand
	- Generate Sufficient Profits and Growth
	- Serve the enterprise long-term
		- How do you resolve with startup entrepreneurs having early exit strategies? (e.g. therapeutics)
	- Establish the right growth rate

**Can I do it?**
- Resources
- Infrastructure
	- How do you ensure delegation is well-organized and supervised effectively?
	- I feel like a lot of the problems that I see in this case are very much involving role issues or inadequate workers
- Role Flexibility
