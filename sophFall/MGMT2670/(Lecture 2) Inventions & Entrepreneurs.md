**Do you have a Feature, a Product, or a Company?**

*What did Philo invent/figure out?*
- Known as the inventor of the television
- Does inventing the Image Dissector make him the "Father of Television"?
	- My opinion is yes, I believe that all theoretical people are the "fathers" of key technologies or concepts
- What would make Philo an entrepreneur?
	- Didn't sell units

Marconi - Inventor of the radio
- People realized that radio was helpful as a safety device to actually save people
- Improving transmission
- Sarnoff: Proved radio could be entertainment, not just information - described fighting match through telephone to send it out to movie houses to hear play-by-play

David Sarnoff:
- Competing Father of the Television

What does Philo Farnsworth Have?
- He had a feature, but not a product

As an inventor who has a technology, we need to understand the value proposition of the technology

**Value Proposition of the Technology:**
- What is the **value or benefit** that your technology promises to potential consumers and other stakeholders?

It's never going to take off if they don't start working. And the whole industry is going to die. So let's make a deal. He brought together 4 different sewing machine companies: Amy Howell Singer, Wheeler & Wilson, and his firm, Grover & Baker. And they came together. Between them, they had a ton of patents - multiple patents for each one of the functions we need to make our machine go. So together, they have all the pieces they need to make a bunch of different designs of sewing machines that will all actually work.

(They only had a feature, needed the 1856 technology trust patents)

**Technology Integration:**
- Need your product to work with other products

King Gillette:
- Inventor of the safety razor
- 2 Technologies/Features:
	- Capability of swapping blades
	- Ergonomic Handle
- Product:
	- Safety Razor
- Just having a Feature and a Product is not enough
- **Need some way to sell this**
- Company:
	- Razor and Blade Model:
		- Let's make the razor itself cheap
		- Make the blade really expensive so that others are already dependent on the razor blade
- Business Model:
	- The system of **interconnected organizational activities** performed by your firm to create and capture value
	- Many definitions and perspectives:
		- Peter Drucker
			- Who is your customer, what does the customer value, and how do you deliver value at an appropriate cost?
		- ...
	- The set of organizational activities that all you to make a profit from some product
- Is this enough? **NO**
	- Need a team or something to fight off competitors and others

 the real profit and the real competition came on these extras. Things like, "Does it have a radio? I think by this point some of them might have had seatbelts, but not very many. Not required yet, that was an extra. And one of the things that was kind of the holy grail was intermittent windshield wipers. So you have windshield wipers on your car. If you've ever gone to the Franklin Institute, there's a story of how a woman on a trolley in New York got fed up watching the trolley driver have to stop the vehicle and go out and clear the windshield, so she invented the windshield wiper. But we have windshield wipers on our cars, but they only move at one speed. And if it's raining really hard, that might not be fast enough. If it's raining really light, that might be too slow and it's going to streak and make noises. So what the car industry thought would be really cool around this time, and every car company on the planet was trying to invent, was windshield wipers where we could change the speed - and they work slow, they work fast, we could have that be somehow adjustable 

 where he went, what if the windshield wiper was like your eye? It blinks. So what I can do is extend or shrink the pause between blinks on the windshield wiper. That's how I can make it changeable. 

He came up with a pretty simple circuit. If any of you take a class on electronics, you'll see more complicated circuits than this in a first-semester class on electronics. It's a pretty simple circuit, but Bob was the first one to come up with it. He was the person who figured it out, and he patented it. He had a technology, a value proposition, and he had a patent

Bob's Business Model:
- Sell units to the car companies to put on their cars
- Decided which individual in his family would be a part of his business
- He had a feature and a product that he can make
- Then he can make a company
- Problem:
	- Obsolete/competition with car companies
	- He wanted to be the ONLY manufacturer of his variable windshield wipers
- It's not enough to come up with a business model that you like by yourself, need a business problem that the entire **ecosystem** likes
- Ended up winning his lawsuits, but never licensed his product to anybody

**Business Ecosystem:**
- Alignment structure of a **multilateral set of partners** that need to interact in order for a value proposition to materialize
- Four basic elements
	- Activities - discrete actions to be undertaken
	- Actors - entities that undertake the activities
	- Positions - where in the flow of activities actors are located and who hands off to whom
	- Links - transfers across actors

What does this mean for you and your technology startup?
- A lot of steps, just the feature/product is a starting point but need way more
- The choices you make will make or break your product and business
- Where to start?
	- If you start from technology, these are the questions that you may need to ask
- It is not enough to have the potential to create value, you actually need to make value

How common is it for someone to take both the role of an inventor and a marketer?
- There are founders that start off being both
- As the company grows, need to be more specialized to serve as one or the other
- Key issue: Time (you cannot serve both roles)
	- Some people can just hire a team and delegate tasks
	- (as opposed to co-founders)
- Problem is some co-founders could fight

Session Takeaways:
**Inventions & Entrepreneurs**
- Invention (cool technology that does its own thing) isn't enough
	- **Innovation** includes the market
	- **Entrepreneurship** includes the business activities
- You need to understand what you really have:
	- a feature?
	- a product?
	- a company?
- Where do you fit in the Business Ecosystem?
- What you can do depends on what you have and what your goals are
	- If they are not aligned, you will have to change something
- Questions to ask as you fill in your strategy:
	- Value Proposition
		- What is the **value** or benefit that your technology promises to potential consumers and other stakeholders?
	- Technology Integration
		- What **other technology*** do you need for your chosen product?
	- Business Model
		- What is your **system of activities*** to create and capture value?
	- Business Ecosystem
		- **Who else*** is necessary...

**Technology Assessment Questions:**
- Think about value creation from a technology
- Not about the firm, focus on the technology
- How does the technology works? 
	- Laymans description
	- "How does it do what it does"
	- What is the value proposition the tech has?
	- (One paragraph)
- What technological value does it create?
	- Different whether the firm, customer, or other people?
	- Firm value from technology 
	- E.g. RCA - moving pictures can now be captured, can use radio towers to transmit the television, can use factories to create radios
	- Think about Customer value - Either people or others (can watch soap operas now)
	- Other stakeholders - who else gains? - Companies who can advertise on radios, people who make plays and radio shows, etc.
- What financial value is captured?
	- Estimate monetary value of company (estimation of dollars)
	- Company profit opposed to marketing cost and other costs
	- Money saved earned for customers
	- Financial estimate (per unit basis, annual sales number, price per television, etc.)
	- At least one stakeholder should have a number (lack of pollution in people's neighborhoods)
- At least two stakeholders for **any** technology (besides company and customers)
- CRISPR: 
	- Company
	- Customers
	- Additional Stakeholders: healthcare providers, insurers, family, etc.
- Don't need too much history of the technology
- A few lines over 5 pages is ok
- Put figures or others after the main 5 page body of the assignment
