**Expectation:** Center of a distribution
- $E(X)=\mu_{x}=\sum_{i}x_{i}\cdot p(x_{i})$
**Methods of Indicators:**
- If $X$ is the number of events that occur among some collection of events $A_{1}, \dots, A_{n}$, then
	- $E(X)=P(A_{1})+P(A_{2})+\dots+P(A_{n})$
- For a r.v. $X$ with possible values $\{0,1,2,\dots,n\}$
	- $E(X)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}P(X \geq j)$
- Coin toss game

**Variance:**
- The expected value measures the ***center*** of a probability distribution
- Variance measures the ***variability*** of a distribution
- Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with possible values $x_{i}$ that occur with probabilities $p(x_{i})$ and l
