Random variables (RV): The real valued function defined over the elements of S.

- The random variable reflects the aspect of a random experiment that is of interest to us
- There are two types of random variables
	- A **discrete** random variable has at most a countable number of possible values
	- A **continuous** random variable takes all values in an interval of numbers
- The **probability distribution** of a r.v. X tells us what the possible values of X are and how probabilities are assigned to those values

*Event is the outcome of a random variable, while a random variable is the collection of all possible outcomes*

**Probability Mass Function (pmf):**
- If X is a discrete rv, the function given by
	- $p(x)=P(X=x)=P(\text{all} s \in S: X(s)=x)$
	- We don't care how we get $x$, just that all outcomes result in $x$
