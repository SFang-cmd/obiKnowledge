**Boolean Simplification:**
```Python
print("Hello World")
```

**De Morgan's Law**
- `~(A & B) = ~A | B`
- `~(A | B) = ~A & ~B`
- Provides a way to convert between AND to OR

**De Morgan's Law: Demo**
- Write a statement equivalent to OR, but without using OR
	- `A | B`
	- `~~(A | B)`
	- `~(~A & ~B)`

**Charge, Current, Voltage**
- Charge can be either positive or negative
- Current: the rate of flow of positive charge
- Voltage: Positive charge want to move from places with higher voltage to lower voltage
