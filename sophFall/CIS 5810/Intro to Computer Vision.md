1600s - Lenses start getting invented
1900s - Kodak invented cameras
2000s - Now smartphones

3 M's of Computer Vision (what makes up a camera?)
1. Mud proof
	- (weather proof, child proof, etc.)
2. Moment
	- (light, time, and space, "re-experience the moment")
3. Memory
	- (find people, objects)

Kodak Moments - Moments that need to be captured

Progress of Generative & Recognition Models
- Visual Recognition
	- Single Object:
		- Classification
		- Classification & Localization
	- Multiple Objects:
		- Object Detection
		- Instance Segmentation
	- Pose Estimation
	- 3D Depth
- Visual Generation
	- StyleGANs
	- Inpainting
	- Outpainting
	- Super-Resolution
	- Text-to-Image

Next Era of AI
- Generation
	- Internet Images --> MJ v1 --> Generated Images --> Curated Images --> MJ v2 -->....
	- Now at MJ v5 or further generations
- Recognition

Causality Discovery from Inpainting/Outpainting
- Shadow Detection
- Reflection Synthesis
- Object Dependency
	- Horse and person are dependent on each other, so system needs to memorize and replace

Another interesting AI project:
- Portrait Shadow Removal (using conditional inputs, remove shadows)
- Virtual Try-on
- First Person Video Segmentation

Key moment slicing
