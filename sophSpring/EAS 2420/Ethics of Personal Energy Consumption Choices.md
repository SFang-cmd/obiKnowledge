### Overview of Challenges in Catastrophe Ethics
#### Milk
- Almond milk may be better for Carbon Footprint, but worse for water footprint, a single almond takes 12 years worth of water
- No good solution, lots of things have tradeoffs

#### Electric Vehicles
- Auto is moving toward EVs
- \$65,000 to cover whole house in solar panels to fully offset electric bill for electric cars
- Airplanes are pretty energy **inefficient**
- **Having a kid has a really large carbon footprint**

#### Purity Ethic
- To what extent should you go to reduce your carbon footprint?
	- Switch to EVs?
	- Don't have kids?
	- Become vegetarian?
- The solution: Purity Ethic
	- Impossible
- Nihilism: Who cares?
	- **Unacceptable**

#### The Puzzle
- How do you live a morally reasonable life in a time of so much bad?
- Roadmap:
	1. The Problem of Causal Inefficacy
	2. The Problem of Moral Efficacy
	3. The Neoliberal Diversion
	4. The Solution
	5. Practical Moral Guidance?

#### No Duty Not to Joyguzzle
- Nihilism: Wrong approach; need to keep thinking

#### The Problem of Moral Efficacy
- You can't control that your contributions change the world
- Need millions of people to make a change
- You can become vegetarian, but if others don't then it doesn't matter
- People might buy from companies they don't necessarily support socially or ethically (almost impossible to avoid/takes a lot of energy and time)

#### The Neoliberal Diversion
- "The effects of individual lifestyle choices are ultimately trivial compared with what politics can achieve"
- Fighting Al Gore: Why should average people change light bulbs when corporations and politics could make a **way** crazier impact?
- Politics is what actually matters

#### Individual Duty is the *wrong target* for collective problems

#### So a plausible catastrophe ethic must:
1. Respond to causal inefficacy in a way that avoids nihilism
	1. Basically say even if you can't do anything by yourself, it doesn't mean it doesn't matter
	2. There is something wrong with joyguzzling
	3. It would be better if you didn't do it
2. Respond to moral efficacy and the diversion of worry in a way that avoids an objectionable focus on one's own purity
	1. Basically make people care about things without worrying about whether it's the pure and moral thing to do
	2. That "something wrong" doesn't imply a duty
	3. We have both positive and negative reasons

### How to organize the reasons we have?
- We need to triage: which efforts should we give our resources to
	- This is both within and between collective moral problems

#### A Catastrophe Ethics Framework
1. Identify massive collective threats, harms, injustices
2. Note that there are two ways to respond: act on recommendations justified by negative reasons and those justified by positive reasons
3. This amounts to specifying in each case how to:
	- Withdraw participation
	- Allocate time, energy, and material resources
