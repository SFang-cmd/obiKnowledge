**Louis Agassiz as a Teacher Notes:**
- **Professor Shaler's Recollections:**
	- His lab was built in a new building 30 long by 15 wide
	- This prof, Shaler, was sat in Agassiz's lab at a desk with a tin pan, where Agassiz asked him to study a small fish
		- Studied for 7 days straight
		- While at first only observing loosely details such as smell of old alcohol, loosened scales close to falling, etc
		- After a 100 hours, he **gathered 100 times more information** than he thought possible
			- How scales went in series
			- The shape of the scales
			- The form and placement of teeth
			- etc.
	- After satisfied with Shaler's results, asked him to study a half peck of bones
		- Skeletons of half a dozen fishes of different species
		- Task was to fit the separate bones together in their proper order
		- Went on for 2 months
		- "That is not right"
	- Once done with this task, continued to the next
	- **Learned the art of comparing objects (naturalist work)**
		- Could share work and discuss with other experts
		- Learned a lot through literature of ichthyology
		- System of classification
		- Figured out that Agassiz's classification was not correct due to Ctenoid and Cycloid scales
		- After this, Agassiz treated prof Shaler as a friend
	- When he wanted to work on geology, Agassiz connected his student to colleagues of his
- **Professor Scudder's Recollections:**
	- Similar story, Professor Scudder first approached Agassiz as a new student in the Scientific School as a natural history student
	- Wanted to learn insects, was first given a jar of specimen in yellow alcohol
		- "Take this fish... we call it a haemulon"
		- "No man is fit to be a naturalist, who does not know how to take care of specimens"
		- Instructed to keep the fish in a tin tray and moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar
		- Thought he had gotten everything from the fish, so searched for Agassiz, but this resulted in the fish becoming dry, which caused it to become bad-looking
		- Being desparate, started looking close at its features, counted scales, feel the teeth, draw the fish
	- "You have not looked very carefully; why, you haven't even seen one of the most conspicuous features of the animal... look again, look again!"
		- I saw how just the Professor's criticism had been
		- "I am certain I do not (see it), but I see how little I saw before"
	- Kept finding new stuff within looking at the fish for **three days**
	- "Facts are stupid things until brought into connection with some general law"
- **Lessons:**
	- Given the same set of facts, it is the details and repetition of experience that allows someone to understand a topic more deeply
	- For high-tech entrepreneurs, the more time you take to look at specific cases and your whole situation from different perspectives, the more likely you will be of making the most optimal decision for any situation

**The Innovator's DNA Notes:**
- **Top implementables:**
	- Spend 15-30 minutes each day writing down 10 new questions that challenge the status quo in your company or industry
	- Spend an entire day observing what customers are trying to get done (observe neutrally)
		- To sharpen your own observational skills, watch how certain customers experience a product or service in their natural environment
		- "What's different than you expected?"
	- "I take pictures of really bad innovations" - Jeff Bezos
	- Hypothesis-test experimentation techniques
		- Attend seminars on topics outside your area of expertise
		- Take apart a product that interests you
		- Learn about different lifestyles
- **The Five Discovery Skills**
	- Doing:
		1. Questioning - Break out of the status quo and consider new possibilities
		2. Observing - Detecting small behavioral details - in the activities of customers, suppliers, and other companies - that suggest new ways of doing things
		3. Experimenting - Try new experiences and explore the world
		4. Networking - Talking to individuals from diverse backgrounds, they gain widely different perspectives
	- Thinking
		5. Associating - Cultivate new insights using the "doing" patterns
- The ability to innovate (creativity) is the "secret sauce" of business success
	- Senior executives in the most innovative companies (15%) **don't delegate creative work**
	- Innovative entrepreneurs spend 50% more time on these discover activities
	- **"The Innovator's DNA"**
- **Innovative Entrepreneurs have "Creative Intelligence"**
- One third of creativity comes from genetics, the other two thirds come from learning
	- Understanding a given skill
	- Practicing the skill
	- Experimenting
	- Gaining confidence in one's capacity to create
- **Discover Skill 1: Associating**
	- The ability to successfully connect seemingly unrelated questions, problems, or ideas from different fields
	- The "Medici Effect"
		- Creative explosion due to Medici family bringing together people from a wide range of disciplines
		- (Sculptors, scientists, poets, philosophers, etc.)
		- New ideas blossomed
	- "Creativity is connecting things" - **Steve Jobs**
		- Studied Calligraphy, Meditation practices, and Mercedes-Benz details
	- The more frequently people try to understand new knowledge, the more easily the brain can recombine associations and create connections between previous things
- **Discovery Skill 2: Questioning**
	- "The important and difficult job is never to find the right answers, it is to find the right questions" - **Peter Drucker**
	- Innovators constantly ask questions that challenge common wisdom
	- "they like to ask: 'if we did this, what would happen?'" - CEO of eBay talking about founders of eBay, PayPal, Skype, etc.
	- Michael Dell asked himself **why computers cost 5 times more than the sum of their parts**, which led to the creation of Dell Computers
	- Innovative Entrepreneurs will ask **Why?** and **Why not?** and **What if?**
		- Compared to most managers, who focus on how to make the "status quo" work a little better
		- "How can we improve widget sales in Taiwan?"
		- vs. Innovative entrepreneurs ("If we cut the size or weight of the widget in half, how would that change the value proposition it offers?")
	- **Imagine Opposites**
		- Innovative thinkers have the "capacity to hold two diametrically opposing ideas in their heads"
		- "They are able to produce a synthesis that is superior to either opposing idea"
		- Innovators often play Devil's Advocate
	- **Embrace Constraints**
		- "What if we were legally prohibited from selling to our current customers? How would we make money next year?"
		- **Great questions actively impose constraints on our thinking to serve for more robust solutions**
		- "Would you do the same thing you are doing today, if you haven't already sunk all this cost in?"
- **Discovery Skill 3: Observing**
	- Discovery-driven executives produce uncommon business ideas by scrutinizing common phenomena
	- Serve as anthropologists and social scientists to explore "why someone does something"
	- Quicken financial software founder observed his wife's struggle with finances, and after seeing Apple Lisa GUI, designed a software that made it easy for people to use
	- *Genchi Genbutsu* - "going to the spot and seeing for yourself"
- **Discovery Skill 4: Experimenting**
	- Real world-experimenting to see what insights emerge
	- Almost treating behavior as a "black box" that we can only know what the inputs are and the outcomes, so trying a variety of different scenarios allows innovators to test unknowns
	- Companies like Amazon allow its employees to experiment: "If we can get processes decentralized so that we can do a lot of experiments without it being very costly, we'll get a lot more innovation" - Scott Cook
	- **Living and working overseas** contributes to a roughly 7% higher market performance on average of CEOs
	- More cultural experiences
- **Discovery Skill 5: Networking**
	- Innovative entrepreneurs network **to meet people with different kinds of ideas and perspectives to extend their own knowledge domains**
	- Entrepreneurs make a conscious effort to visit other countries and meet people from other walks of life
	- They also attend idea conferences such as 
		- Technology, Entertainment, and Design (TED)
		- Davos
		- Aspen Ideas Festival
	- Networking at conferences is very important
	- "The insights required to solve many of our most challenging problems come from outside our industry and scientific field"
	- Adjacent fields will prove to be very useful
- **Practice, Practice, Practice**
	- Best way to get better at being an innovative entrepreneur is to practice and practice until these inclinations of creativity become second-nature
	- Want your whole mentality to be creativity and synthesis into better future products
	- Rehearse over and over the behaviors described above, until they become automatic
	- **Put time aside to actively cultivate more creative ideas**
	- Questioning is the most important: Ask "Why" and "Why not" to **turbocharge the other discovery skills**
- Study the five “discovery skills” that distinguish visionary entrepreneurs. Think carefully about the relevance of the above Agassiz article to the findings of this article. What discipline and skills are common to both? Relate these skills to yourself. Following advice from this article, what can you do to sharpen your personal innovation skills? Be prepared to discuss this article in class.
	- Observing, Associating, Questioning, and to some extent Experimenting
	- Observing, is the most obvious one, since they both require repeated looking at the engines that power industry, and thinking about how different industries have similarities, just like how different fish have similarities and differences
	- Associating as well, since entrepreneurship requires that you can connect seemingly unrelated topics together. In the Agassiz example, the association comes in different principles of zoology, where different animals have similar zoological observational skills
	- Questioning and experimenting in looking at the fish and testing different hypothesis of what the fish looks and acts like. Asking questions about how the fish lived and what different body parts may have had a purpose for



**The New Venture Notes**
- **New Ventures do not have a "business"**
	- May have sales, revenues, profits, etc
	- However, does not have a viable, operating, organized "present"
	- No management - Don't know what they are doing, where they are going, what results are/should be
	- Ex. Thomas Edison - Was able to be an entrepreneur, but refused to build a management team, so failed when companies got to middle size
- **The 4 requirements of Entrepreneurial Management**
	1. **Focus on the market**
	2. Financial foresight and planning for **cash flow** and capital needs ahead
	3. Building a **top management team** long before the new venture actually needs one and long before it can actually afford one
	4. Requires the founding entrepreneur **a decision in respect to his or her own role, area of work, and relationships**
- **Focus on the Market - The product or service is defined by the customer, not by the producer**
	- A venture usually succeeds in a market that it was not originally intended to serve
	- If a venture is not market-driven and totally market-focused to **provide customers with what they want,** then it will succeed only in creating and opportunity for a competitor
	- Only exception is if the product is specifically designed for one specific use (scientific or technical)
	- **New things create markets that nobody before even imagined**
	- The new venture therefore needs to start out with the assumption that its product or service may find customers in markets no one thought of, for uses no one envisaged, and that it will be bought by customers outside its field of vision and even unknown to the new venture.
	- If the new venture does not have such a market focus from the very beginning, all it is likely to create is the market for a competitor
	- **Observe any unexpected successes or unexpected failures as distinct opportunities, experiment with these new markets**
	- **Let new markets test the products with "free samples" to see what they can do with it**
	- Biggest threat in "neo-natal"/early stage ventures
- **Financial Foresight**
	- Biggest threat in rapidly growing new ventures
	- Big culprits
		- Lack of cash
		- Inability to raise the capital needed for expansion
		- Loss of control
	- Cash flow, capital, and controls come much earlier than profit
	- Cash flow analysis, cash flow forecasts, and cash management are needed
	- **Financial management is key for growth**
	- Profit is generally a fake thing in the long run, because that means that the company is not investing in itself
	- Growing ventures should know how much cash it will need 12 months ahead of time
	- **New ventures are under the most cash pressure when the opportunities are greatest**
	- Capital can also be raised through step-by-step continuing to change your capital structure.
		- Each unit breaks even fairly soon (2-3 years)
		- When the operation can be made routine, so limited managerial competence can do a decent job
		- When the individual unit itself reaches fairly swiftly the optimum size beyond which it does not require further capital, but produces cash surplus to help finance the startup of additional units
		- Don't wait until you outgrow your capital structure to finance more, plan at least a year ahead
	- Control of quality, service, inventory, manufacturing costs, is also necessary - make sure to plan **3 years in advance**
- **Building a Top Management Team**
	- A business reaching maturity requires a management team to grow further, otherwise everything else means nothing
	- Make a list of **the specific areas upon which the survival and success of the business depend**
	- Delegate the activities that each one is doing well to those people
	- **CEO's work depends on what the enterprise requires and who the individual is**
