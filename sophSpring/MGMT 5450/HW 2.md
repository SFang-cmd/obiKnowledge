2. Skim the case to grasp all categories of information provided
3. Read the study questions (for case analysis and class preparation)
4. Read the case carefully
	1. Construct a timeline
	2. Simple organization chart (keep characters organized)
	3. Try to figure out your stance in the place of these characters
5. Sort out considerations (pros, cons, etc) for the key problems
6. Develop a solution based upon the analysis

**Louis Agassiz as a Teacher Notes:**
- **Professor Shaler's Recollections:**
	- His lab was built in a new building 30 long by 15 wide
	- This prof, Shaler, was sat in Agassiz's lab at a desk with a tin pan, where Agassiz asked him to study a small fish
		- Studied for 7 days straight
		- While at first only observing loosely details such as smell of old alcohol, loosened scales close to falling, etc
		- After a 100 hours, he **gathered 100 times more information** than he thought possible
			- How scales went in series
			- The shape of the scales
			- The form and placement of teeth
			- etc.
	- After satisfied with Shaler's results, asked him to study a half peck of bones
		- Skeletons of half a dozen fishes of different species
		- Task was to fit the separate bones together in their proper order
		- Went on for 2 months
		- "That is not right"
	- Once done with this task, continued to the next
	- **Learned the art of comparing objects (naturalist work)**
		- Could share work and discuss with other experts
		- Learned a lot through literature of ichthyology
		- System of classification
		- Figured out that Agassiz's classification was not correct due to Ctenoid and Cycloid scales
		- After this, Agassiz treated prof Shaler as a friend
	- When he wanted to work on geology, Agassiz connected his student to colleagues of his
- **Professor Scudder's Recollections:**
	- Similar story, Professor Scudder first approached Agassiz as a new student in the Scientific School as a natural history student
	- Wanted to learn insects, was first given a jar of specimen in yellow alcohol
		- "Take this fish... we call it a haemulon"
		- "No man is fit to be a naturalist, who does not know how to take care of specimens"
		- Instructed to keep the fish in a tin tray and moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar
		- Thought he had gotten everything from the fish, so searched for Agassiz, but this resulted in the fish becoming dry, which caused it to become bad-looking
		- Being desparate, started looking close at its features, counted scales, feel the teeth, draw the fish
	- "You have not looked very carefully; why, you haven't even seen one of the most conspicuous features of the animal... look again, look again!"
		- I saw how just the Professor's criticism had been
		- "I am certain I do not (see it), but I see how little I saw before"
	- Kept finding new stuff within looking at the fish for **three days**
	- "Facts are stupid things until brought into connection with some general law"
- **Lessons:**
	- Given the same set of facts, it is the details and repetition of experience that allows someone to understand a topic more deeply
	- For high-tech entrepreneurs, the more time you take to look at specific cases and your whole situation from different perspectives, the more likely you will be of making the most optimal decision for any situation

**The Innovator's DNA Notes:**
- **The Five Discovery Skills**
	- Doing:
		1. Questioning - Break out of the status quo and consider new possibilities
		2. Observing - Detecting small behavioral details - in the activities of customers, suppliers, and other companies - that suggest new ways of doing things
		3. Experimenting - Try new experiences and explore the world
		4. Networking - Talking to individuals from diverse backgrounds, they gain widely different perspectives
	- Thinking
		5. Associate - Cultivate new insights using the "doing" patterns
- The ability to innovate (creativity) is the "secret sauce" of business success
- 
- Study the five “discovery skills” that distinguish visionary entrepreneurs. Think carefully about the relevance of the above Agassiz article to the findings of this article. What discipline and skills are common to both? Relate these skills to yourself. Following advice from this article, what can you do to sharpen your personal innovation skills? Be prepared to discuss this article in class.
