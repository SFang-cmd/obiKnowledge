### Revisit Key Financial Statements Concepts
- **Income Statement (aka Profit & Loss Statement, P&L, Statement of Operations)**
	- Reflects the financial performance of a company, matching revenue & expenses, in a given time period (month, quarter, year)
	- $Net Income = Revenue - Expenses$
	- $Gross Margin = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold$
	- Non-cash expenses (depreciation & amortization)
		- Tangible vs Intangible assets
- **Balance Sheet**
	- Reflects what the company owns (assets) and what the company owes (liabilities) as the claim shareholders have (shareholders equity)
	- $Assets=Liabilities + Shareholders Equity$
	- Key Concepts: Accounts receivables, accounts payable, current vs. non-current (assets & liabilities), accumulated depreciation & amortization, and when we get to VC; additional paid-in capital
- **Statement of Cash Flows**
	- Reports changes in the company's cash resulting from business activities
	- Reflects timing variance between recognition of revenue/expenses and cash flow
	- **Reconciles the time differences between different time periods**
	- Requires Income Statement for current period and Balance Balance Sheet for current
		- Begins with Net Income
		- Add back depreciation (and other non-cash expenses)
		- Increase/Decrease for changes in assets and liabilities

**Important Financial Ratios**
- **Inventory turn (higher)**
	- Speed at which inventory is produced and sold
- **Collection period (lower)**
	- Number of days it takes to convert receivables into cash
	- If the number of days decreases, **money will be in company accounts faster instead of customer accounts**

#### Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)
- Reports how long your cash will be tied up
- Not available to you for growing business
	- $DPO: Days\;payable\;oustanding = \frac{Accts\;Payable}{\frac{COGS}{365}}$
	- DOI: Days of Inventory = Inventory / (COGS/365)
	- DCP: Days Collection Period = Accts Receivable / (Sales/365)
	- $CCC = DOI + DCP - DPO$
- Dell's Cash Conversion Cycle was **Negative**
	- Meant they didn't need funding because they were so cash positive

#### All of Dell's Innovations Led to Cost Leadership
- Basically their innovations were between sales to and from suppliers and Dell
- Still have better inventory management
