A dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future

### Present/Future Value Analysis
- $PV=FV\times (1 + r)^{-n}=FV / (1 + r)^n$
- $FV = PV \times (1+r)^n$
- PV: Present Value
- FV: Future Value
- r: cost of capital (or discount rate or return on investment)
- n: number of periods until FV is received
- Net Present Value = NPV
	- $[FV_{0}\times (1 + r)^{-0]}+ [FV_{1}\times (1 + r)^{-1}] + \dots + [FV_{n} \times (1 + r)^{-n}]$

### Net Present Value Analysis - Discounted Cash Flows (DCF)
- Invest in a piece of equipment for \$50,000 at the beginning of analysis time period (negative cash flow)
- Use the equipment to generate \$9,000 each year for the next eight (8) years (positive cash flow)

### Bootstrapping is the norm!
- 80% of "500" companies fund growth with personal savings + sales
- \$10k median startup capital

### Bootstrapping is the rule rather than the exception
- Avoids distraction from mission
- Enhances flexibility
- Maintains founder ownership
- Maintains founder control
- **Main Benefit** is the flexibility

### Accelerators are a popular startup option for services versus funding
- YC
- 500 Startups
- Techstars
- Dreamt

### Priming the cash pump with others' \$\$\$
- Investors invest money
	- Founders
	- Friends & Family
	- Economic Development Agencies
- Get Securities (Debt and Equity) in return
	- Exception is SAFE

### High technology startups are different from mature, stable companies; therefore, they use VC Method and not DCF
- Unpredictable revenue, expenses, cash flows
- Refining strategy, business model, ops, team
- High risk capital expect high returns; therefore, cost of capital for growth is high
- Returns realized *not* from profits, but from increase in (and realization of) share value

### VC Method
- $\frac{Investment (\$)}{\%_{ownership}}=Post-Money Valuation$
- Pre-Money Valuation = (Post-Money Valuation) - (Investment)
- $ROI=\left( \frac{\text{\$ Total Returns}}{\text{\$ Total invested}} \right)^{1/years}$
