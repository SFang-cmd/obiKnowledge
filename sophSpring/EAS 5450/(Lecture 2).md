**Stevenson Entrepreneurial Framework**
- There are 3 key things that we need to bring together to seize opportunity and drive leadership
	- Product/Strategy
	- Team
	- Cash

**Peter Drucker**
1. Market Focus
	- Customer Perspective is important
	- "New" = unexpected (is key to success)
	- Association
	- How to set yourself up to expect the unexpected?
		- Experimentation
		- Observation
	- Customers dictate "product"
	- Avoid **assumptions**
	- Ex. Apple is usually 1-2 generations behind in innovation - instead, they give people the "wants"/focus on the customer market
	- **For HP**
		- "Next bench" - company of engineers building for engineers
		- With the audio oscillator - "We're open to changing audiences"
		- Test w/ the market; open to change
		- No "me too"
		- Product focus - do it or sell it; capture value
		- Constant innovation
		- **Better mankind**
	- Validate results
	- **Don't try to build a startup that sells to "everybody"**
2. Financial Foresight
	- Influx of cash
	- **Need to plan for the future**
		- Companies will only go out of business when you don't have cash to spend
	- **Planning for growth**
	- "Overhaul" each time we spend finances
		- Need to place controls/procedures
	- Profit $\neq$ cash
		- Timing issue
		- Should not recognize the sale before receiving the cash
	- Cash is King/Queen (Credit = Queen/King)
	- No debt! (due to HP founder experiences)
	- For Non-VC's - Growth slower, more stable - as fast as our "success"
	- HP was bootstrapped: \$538 starting (strict in their cash management - frugal)
3. Top Management Team
	- Before you need it/don't wait
	- People - skills
	- When do you need it?
		- What will you do (product vision statement)
	- TRUST is important - need to build a relationship
	- Want to find complementary skill sets
	- Hire "needed skills" based on what the company needs
4. Role of Founder
	- The role of the founder will change over the different stages of the company's growth
	- Role of the founder changes
	- **Important for mentors and advisors to exist**
