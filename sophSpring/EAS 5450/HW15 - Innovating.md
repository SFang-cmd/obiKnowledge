### Open vs. Closed Innovation
- From the perspective of a high-tech entrepreneur, what are the implications of this article in terms of opportunities to be seized?
	- This article serves to show that a high-tech entrepreneur need not internally develop all the R&D that a tech product may need
	- This means that a much less up-front investment of resources, money, and time is required to create any sort of initial high tech product
	- Entrepreneurs can draw from all types of funding sources:
		- Innovation Investors: (initially) Corporate R&D, VC firms, Corporate VC entities, Private Equity investors, Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs)
		- Benefactors: Early stage research funding (National Labs, Research Funds, Philanthropists)
	- Some entrepreneurs may generate some portions of the innovation, though it is kinda not required now:
		- Innovation Explorers: Research for the sake of research
		- Merchants: Focused on a narrow set of tech to license
		- Architects: Frameworks and designs that allow plug-and-play from other companies and products
		- Missionaries: Non-profits and products that serve a specific purpose only
	- **Most** entrepreneurs will serve in the space of commercializing innovations, namely creating value and marketing products to others
	- This means that entrepreneurs just need to be able to sell a product and develop some sort of proprietary moat, not even necessarily a very complex product differentiation
- How does the Open Innovation model affect the source of innovative ideas and the commercialization of innovative products by both startup ventures and established corporations?
	- Innovative ideas no longer need to come from just the entrepreneur's own research or the entrepreneur's own ideas; they can come from an entrepreneur's ideas along with other open innovation ideas from outside entities such as researchers, companies, and labs.
	- For established corporations, this means that they are able to filter through "false negatives" in which an idea, which initially may seem to have little promise, is proven to have high promise externally.
	- Corporations can now license their own proprietary innovations, but they are also able to incorporate other people's proprietary innovations
- How might the Open Innovation model affect a startup company’s choice of operational strategy as discussed in our earlier reading, “Innovating for Cash?”
	- This means that the startup can pour more of their investment into economic/marketing while minimizing the R&D budget initially. This will allow them to capture a larger market and still maintain a high-quality product
- Why is the Open Innovation model more relevant to the high-tech economy in the United States today than it was during most of the 20th century?
	- The Open Innovation model is made increasingly possible due to the large growth of high-capability individuals who no longer have the societal requirement of sticking to working for one company their entire life


- Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky are faced with four financing options. Which of the options should they choose?
	- Given these 4 financing options, the one that makes the most sense without modification should be option 1. 
	- I think an interesting modification that could have potential is to pursue the USR full acquistion deal. However, the natural downside in this option is the fact that the Palm team has no idea of the USR's true intentions, so it should be written into the term sheet that at any point during the first product development from Palm, this deal can be reversed with some form of 5% return on investment given to USR. That way, they are incentivized to see Palm succeed as they don't have full control yet.
- What is your primary reason for choosing this option?
	- This allows Hawkins and Dubinsky to maintain a relatively large control over their resulting company while also providing a fair valuation (\$30 million) that investing can be raised. This strategy also means that an additional VC funding would be factored in, and Alpha Computers is supposedly now much more flexible due to the inclusion of USR in negotiations.
- What are the pros and cons of these options and what criteria did you use to evaluate them?
	- The pros are that using this option, Palm computing maintains control of their company while raising a substantial \$3 million dollars in perceived funding
	- The cons are that Alpha Computers seem intent on placing the onus and risk squarely on the shoulders of the Palm Computing company. Due to this risk averse mindset, they may not have Palm Computing's growth as their number one priority, which could lead to further conflicts later on.
	- I mainly evaluated the choices based on percent equity owned, valuation, and amount of capital raised for each of the options, since the real struggle that Palm Computing had at the time was with capital flow and raising enough funds to execute a batch of production for their devices
- What do you see as the major drawbacks to your choice?
	- The major drawbacks for the Alpha Computers choice is that the money being raised is at a \$30 million dollar valuation, which is the same as the post-money valuation of their previous round of funding. This stagnation along with the fact that USR is offering a total premium of \$50 million in their valuation of Palm means that taking this deal would mean accepting a worse deal, allowing higher equity for Alpha Computers and potential Term Sheet disagreements.
- What would the cap table look like for the various options? To help you, I am including a table summarizing Palm’s first three rounds of funding:
