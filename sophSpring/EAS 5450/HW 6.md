### Innovating for Cash
- It doesn't matter how cool your idea is, if you can't execute, then you won't be a profitable company
- **Key question:** How can you make a product profitable? (Commercialize a product?)
- Three approaches to take a new product to market:
	1. Integrators
	2. Orchestrators
	3. Licensors

### What is an innovation approach?
- A broad management framework that helps companies turn **ideas** into **financial returns**
- Used when launching new products or services, introducing improvements to products or services, or exploiting new business opportunities and disruptive technologies.
- Different from **innovation strategies** (first mover, fast follower) and **ownership structures** (joint venture, strategic alliance)
- ***Extends beyond new product development or product life cycle management***

#### Innovation-to-cash chain
- Companies manage all stages of the process, which allows them to turn profits

#### 1. Integrators
- Most companies are most familiar with this approach
- Do everything yourself by linking multiple things together
- Best for stable fields, existing markets, well-understood customer tastes, etc.
- **Con:** Requires expertise in EVERYTHING - manufacturing, marketing, cooperation, etc.
	- Most up-front investment
	- Most time to commercialize

#### 2. Orchestrator
- Draws on assets/capabilities of partners
- Only responsible for specific assets and capabilities to contribute to the whole process
- Used to launch products quickly or reduce investment costs
- **Cons:** Riskier; less quality control on all parts
	- Must be very good at managing projects and developing partnerships
	- Must protect intellectual property due to increased flow of information between partners
	- Product's success/failure depends on activities of partners, so hard to handle

#### 3. Licensing
- Used in biotech, IT
- When the market is new to the company and the company only wants to build a specific tech out
- Where the pace of technological change is rapid and risks are high
- Often ask for equity in final products
- **Licensors** primarily play a role in early stages of the innovation-to-cash cycle
- Need to have smart intellectual property management, legal, and negotiation to succeed
- **Cons:** Must be hard-headed to sell innovations as parts, not "the next big idea"

#### Company Strategy
- Typically, companies need to be smart about what strategy they use
- The most comfortable one often isn't the best one

### Polaroid Case Study
- Vertically integrated (Integrators)
- Used to 20-year patent protections and long product development cycles
- **Issue:** Moore's law; new digital tech was advancing too fast for those long development cycles
- Because they wanted to stay in-house, research was expensive and new products were expensive as well
	- \$2,955 - \$4,995 for first Polaroid
	- Other competitors were below \$1,000 and released 5 years earlier
- **Could have** focused on key digital technologies and outsourced the manufacturing of the digital cameras to other companies (orchestrator)
- **Or could have** licensed image-processing software to third parties (licensing)

#### Post-change
- Pivoted to an orchestrator
- Outsourced manufacturing of digital cameras to Taiwan
- Added cosmetic features, and sold in Wal-Mart, etc.
- Market share jumped from 0.1% to 10.4% in 1 year (1999-2000)

### Choosing the right approach
- Need to analyze the **industry, innovation, and risks**

#### The Industry
- Company needs to understand the current industry structure
- Need to think about
	1. Physical assets to enter the industry (e.g. investment in factories?)
	2. The nature of the supply chain (Are partners mature/unsophisticated? Any exclusive contracts with competitors?)
	3. Importance of brands (Will our brand provide a permanent or temporary advantage?)
	4. The intensity of rivalry (What strategies will rivals use to respond to our entry?)

#### The Innovation
- Look at product's potential life cycle to find window to recoup investments
	- Disk drive has fast development, so should probably look into being orchestrators and incorporating the latest technologies
- Radical breakthroughs will require additional resources to ramp up production when demand takes off
	- Could benefit to license or orchestrate with other companies to meet demand and increase market segment
- Also need to consider the product's complements and infrastructure planning
- Patent protections tend to lead companies toward integration, since there's no competitive pressures

#### Risks
1. Will the innovation work in a technical sense?
2. The customer will not buy the new product
3. Substitutes/Competitors shrink margins
4. The investment that the company needs for commercialization

### Examples
- Microsoft became an orchestrator that works on the game development for a product Xbox that they want to build.
- Whirlpool transitioned from integrator to orchestrator for a new project they were exploring with little money and a tight timeline

### Notes:
- Which of the three business models discussed in today’s reading, "_Innovating for Cash_," did Jeff Hawkins/Palm adopt for the Pilot organizer product? How did it differ from the business model Tandy adopted for the Zoomer? What are the benefits of each business model?
	- For their Pilot organizer product, Jeff instead adopted an integrator approach, which allowed him to maintain tight quality control and design development.
	- Only selectively partnering for manufacturing and distribution
	- Differed from Tandy's Orchestrator model that relied heavily on partnerships (Casio)
	- Faster time to market due to partnerships, but lacked quality control and execution
- Why did Jeff Hawkins succeed in launching a “personal digital assistant” (PDA) where others had invested $1 billion without success?
	- Customer-centric focus. While other companies 
- What lessons did Jeff Hawkins learn from his “Zoomer” product?
- From the birth of Palm Computing in January 1992 to the time of the case in 1997, trace the product development process for the PalmPilot?
