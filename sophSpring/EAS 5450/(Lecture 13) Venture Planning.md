### Venture Capital is a Path for both VCs and Entrepreneurs
#### For Entrepreneurs
- Idea: Technology & Entrepreneur
- Opportunity: Product & Customer
- Business Opportunity: Venture & Econ Feasibility
- Investment Opportunity: Investor & Harvest

#### For VCs
- Fundraise: Fund & Ltd Partners
- Screen: Entrepreneurs & Deals
- Invest: Teams & Plans
- Grow: Venture & Execution
- Harvest: Exit & Returns

#### Important to see the communication between each
- Idea and product needs to interest investors
- Entrepreneurship
	- Bite
	- Pitch
	- Plan
- VC
	- Due Diligence
	- Term Sheet
	- Investment Deal

#### VC has unlimited upside
- The carried return can grow exponentially if the company grows exponentially
- For invested companies in a round:
	- Many go bust
	- Many return minimal (1%-5%)
	- Some are successful (100%+)
	- Generally around 1 or 2 are home runs (IPO/Acquisition)

#### Companies issue new shares of stock from pool of authorized shares established at time of incorporation
- Authorizing new shares is like "making things up"
- **Issuing** shares is the only situation that dilutes

### Investment Equations
- $\text{\% acquired} = \frac{\text{Investment}}{\text{Post-Money Valuation}}$
- $\text{Post-Money Valuation}=\text{Pre-Money Valuation} + \text{Investment}$

### "Bootstrap for as long as you can"
- Spend as little money as possible to find product-market fit
- VC is typically only necessary to accelerate growth

### Valuation Metrics
#### The EBITDA
- Earnings, Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization
- So a company with 100,000 EBITDA with 10x this valuation means that the company may be worth \$1,000,000

#### Market Valuation
- $\text{Number of Issued Shares}\times \text{Price Per Share} = \text{Market Value}$

### The VC Method
- Number each investment as a "round"

#### Single-Priced Round Investment
- Value of Investment: $VI_{N}=I_{0}(1 + ROI)^{N}$
- $\text{\% Ownership}=\frac{VI_{N}}{V_{N}}=\frac{I_{0}\times(1+ROI)^N}{P/E\times E_{N}}$
	- Where N = years from investment to liquidity event
- $\text{\% Ownership}=\frac{\text{\# of Shares Purchased}}{\text{Total \# Shares Issued}}$
- $\text{\% Ownership} = \frac{\text{\# Shares Purchased}}{\text{\# Old Shares} + \text{\# Shares Purchased}}$
- $\text{\# New Shares} = \frac{\text{\% Ownership}}{1 - \% Ownership} \times \text{\# Old Shares}$
- $\text{\$ Price per Share} = \frac{\text{Investment (\$)}}{\text{\# Shares Purchased}}$
- $\text{Post-Money Valuation}=\frac{\text{Investment (\$)}}{\text{\% Ownership}}$
	- OR $\text{Post-Money Valuation}=\frac{\text{New Price}}{Share} \times \text{(Total \# Shares Issued)}$
- $\text{Pre-Money Valuation}=(\text{Post-Money Valuation})-\text{(Investment)}$
	- OR $\text{Pre-Money Valuation}=\frac{\text{New Price}}{Share} \times \text{(\# Old Shares)}$

#### Multiple Rounds, All Priced
- Value of Investment: $VI_{N}=I_{0}(1 + ROI)^{N-i}$
	- For each sub-year round
- **Issue:** Value invested will become diluted, so ROI will be less
	- $\text{\%N}=\frac{VI_{i,N}}{V_{N}}$
- **Must** also factor in Retention:
	- $\text{Retention \%} = 100\% - \sum(\text{Final \% of Later Rounds})$
	- $\% Acquired=\frac{\text{Terminal Ownership \%}}{\text{Retention \% / 100\%}}$
	- $\%\text{Acquired} = \frac{\# \text{ of Shares Owned}}{\text{Total } \# \text{ Shares Issued}}$
	- $\%\text{Acquired} = \frac{\#\text{New Shares}}{\#\text{Old Shares} + \# \text{ New Shares}}$
	- $\# \text{ New Shares} = \frac{(\%\text{Acquired})}{(1 - \%\text{Acquired})} \times (\# \text{ Old Shares})$
	- $\text{\$ Price per Share} = \frac{\text{Investment (\$)}}{\text{\# Shares Purchased}}$
- $\text{Post-Money Valuation}=\frac{\text{Investment (\$)}}{\text{\% Ownership}}$
	- OR $\text{Post-Money Valuation}=\frac{\text{New Price}}{Share} \times \text{(Total \# Shares Issued)}$
- $\text{Pre-Money Valuation}=(\text{Post-Money Valuation})-\text{(Investment)}$
	- OR $\text{Pre-Money Valuation}=\frac{\text{New Price}}{Share} \times \text{(\# Old Shares)}$
