### Vermeer Wrap-up
- Microsoft was clear that Vermeer would be integrated within the Office suite
- Netscape was good: You don't need to relocate or anything
- **Burger Company:** A company that is *built to be flipped*
- Took some percentage of VC money-why?
	- Hoped to increase valuation - went from \$70MM to \$130MM and eventually \$160MM after announcement (Microsoft stock went up)

#### Vermeer Financing & Harvest
$\%Acquired=\frac{Investment}{Post-Money\;Valuation}$
$Post-Money\;Valuation = Pre-Money\;Valuation+Investment$
- Post money valuation was at 7.8, but a few months later, pre money valuation increased to 32 million - **why?**
	- The investors and others literally agreed on this valuation according to their current trajectory and positioning
- Each share percent gets diluted when new investors invest
- After acquisition, just multiply percent owned by dollar valuation

#### Patent(s) in Palm A Case
- Pattern recognition algorithm **applied** to handwriting recognition
- "Swipes" --> digital data
- Hardware Device --> ?
- Design patent --> ?
- C extensions --> --> Any improvements will revert to the owner
	- Issue: GRiD technically owns the improvements
	- But Hawkins technically has the right to C Extend to his improvements
	- But Tandey also cannot do anything with it
