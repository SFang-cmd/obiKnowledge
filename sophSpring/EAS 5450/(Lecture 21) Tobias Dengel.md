### 5 Things I Wish I'd Learned in School (decision making)
- **Maintain your relationships:** important for networking
- Became friends with Adam Silver for consulting and analyst at Aol
	- Still invited to All-Star Game
- Consultant doesn't have hands on the reel; VC even less so
- WillowTree - Need to explain a company in a minute or less (Elevator Pitch)
	- Building mobile apps for companies etc.
- Part of TELUS Digital (Co-President after acquisition)
#### 1. Know Thyself
- Do what you're good at
- Do things the way you can, not by emulating others
- Everyone has their own unique style to operate
#### 2. Business is Driven By Sales
- Having incredible sales people is life or death
#### 3. Sales is Driven by Marketing/Branding
- Positioning and naming of a brand is extremely imporant
#### 4. Culture is Everything
- All human beings, generally speaking, aspire to be good people
- Need people to help each other to create a culture of success
- Large companies fail when economics of scale get overwhelmed by dis-economics of motivation
	- Need people to be motivated to do amazing work
- How much people work depends a very high percentage on the fairness of treatment/pay
	- Having best friends, etc. are more important
#### 5. Make the Trend Your Friend
- Best investment strategy is momentum investment
- Circumstances rule men, men don't control circumstances
- Virality and trends just happen, you want to be ready to capture it

### What's next?
- GenAI can also be used as an input, not just an output
- The future coding language will just be english
	- GenAI can understand natural language and it will be eventually good enough to understand what people want to program and just implement it

### Trust
- Adoption of new technology requires TRUST
- **Emotional Trust:** Someone judges whether they trust you and want to talk to you within 10 seconds to 10 minutes of meeting you
- **Cognitive Trust:** Over time, humans transition from emotional trust to cognitive trust; is not trustworthy because they don't do what they say they will do
	- Applies to software just the same as human beings
	- Implementing voice we failed on both trust

### Why Voice Failed
- The uncanny valley: Right before being fully human, humanoid things are considered creepy
- The answer to voice is not making it more human-like, just more reliable

### Why Voice
- **Core problem with voice:** Technically slower
	- Speaking + Listening takes 130wpm + 130wpm
	- Typing + Reading takes 40wpm + 250 wpm
	- Thus, the whole suite of typing is actually faster than needing to speak
- So want voice as an input, but reading as an output
- Voice and LLMs are going to change the world because they can intuitively interpret what you're saying
- Personal LLMs and industry-specific LLMs will help increase accuracy much higher
