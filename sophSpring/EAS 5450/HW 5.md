- How should we assess the market potential for a new high-tech first of its kind product? Describe each step in the process.
- What/who are “stakeholders” and what role do they play in the process of shaping an idea into a product?
- How do “concepts” differ from “ideas” and how do concepts evolve from ideas?
- How do “products” differ from concepts and how do products evolve from concepts?
- What purpose(s) do prototypes serve in the product development process?

**Innovation funnel:** Ideas and maximum flexibility at the beginning narrows down to fewer and fewer options near the end
- Highly dependent on project scope and resources it can consumer
- If too many resources, then projects approved originally may now have to be abandoned
- **Customer needs and technological possibilities** combine together for concept generation and selection, product design, prototyping and testing, pilot production, and finally manufacturing ramp up and release

**Stage Gate Model:** Each stage has a gate that is essentially a decision for if the product should move forward
1. Ideation (Gate: Initial Screen)
2. Preliminary Investigation (Gate: Second Screen)
3. Detailed Investigation (build business case) (Gate: Decision on Business Case)
4. Development (Gate: Post-Development Review)
5. Testing & Validation (Gate: Pre-Launch Business Analysis)
6. Full Production & Market Launch (Gate: Post-Implementation Review)

**Ways to estimate size and product growth potential**
- Population-based estimates: What percentage of the population may buy a certain product or product category (TVs, etc.)
- Population usage-based estimates: Number of customers multiplied by the number of purchase occasions per year and the average number of units purchased on each occasion
- Forecasting by analogy: Finding similar products and estimating for a new product category
- Forecasting by percentage of complementary product sales: Finding the data of a product used in unison with the current product to see market growth
- Forecasting based on past competitor performance: See how current product categories will do based on established companies
