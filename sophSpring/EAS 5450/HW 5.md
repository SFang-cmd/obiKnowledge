- How should we assess the market potential for a new high-tech first of its kind product? Describe each step in the process.
	- 
- What/who are “stakeholders” and what role do they play in the process of shaping an idea into a product?
- How do “concepts” differ from “ideas” and how do concepts evolve from ideas?
- How do “products” differ from concepts and how do products evolve from concepts?
- What purpose(s) do prototypes serve in the product development process?

**Innovation funnel:** Ideas and maximum flexibility at the beginning narrows down to fewer and fewer options near the end
- Highly dependent on project scope and resources it can consumer
- If too many resources, then projects approved originally may now have to be abandoned
- **Customer needs and technological possibilities** combine together for concept generation and selection, product design, prototyping and testing, pilot production, and finally manufacturing ramp up and release

**Stage Gate Model:** Each stage has a gate that is essentially a decision for if the product should move forward
1. Ideation (Gate: Initial Screen)
2. Preliminary Investigation (Gate: Second Screen)
3. Detailed Investigation (build business case) (Gate: Decision on Business Case)
4. Development (Gate: Post-Development Review)
5. Testing & Validation (Gate: Pre-Launch Business Analysis)
6. Full Production & Market Launch (Gate: Post-Implementation Review)

**Ways to estimate size and product growth potential**
- Population-based estimates: What percentage of the population may buy a certain product or product category (TVs, etc.)
- Population usage-based estimates: Number of customers multiplied by the number of purchase occasions per year and the average number of units purchased on each occasion
- Forecasting by analogy: Finding similar products and estimating for a new product category
- Forecasting by percentage of complementary product sales: Finding the data of a product used in unison with the current product to see market growth
- Forecasting based on past competitor performance: See how current product categories will do based on established companies

### Developing the Product
- **Concept Generation**
	- *Identify Stakeholders:* Workers, employees, customers, third parties
	- *What information do you gather from stakeholders?* What sorts of questions should you ask stakeholders for them to figure out what you want? Want an empathetic team/person on team to figure out what these people want
	- *What do you do with the information you gathered?* 


- At the earliest days of a startup, who is the salesperson?
	- You are the salesperson! Dedicate one founder to this activity
- What is a sales funnel?
	- It is the way you narrow down the people you talk to so that eventually you've found your target audience that will pay for your product
- When you're an early-stage tech company full of risk, who are your customers along the Diffusion of Innovation curve and what are the implications for your sales efforts/approach?
	- You're looking for the innovators, first 2.5% of adopters
	- Because the percentage is so small, it is optimal to reach out and talk to as many people as possible
	- It is very much a numbers game
- How do you effectively reach prospective customers?
	- Personal Network, Conferences, Cold Emails
	- Conferences need to be relevant
	- Cold Emails should be concise
- What is the key characteristic of a successful sales conversation?
	- How much you talk vs how much they talk. If your potential clients are talking more than you, it's more likely to be successful
- How should your sales approach change over time to become a $100 million company (in annual sales) depending on the deal size of each sale?
	- For more customers that pay less, you need to increase your marketing
	- If you are looking to market to fewer customers but you need higher payments per year, then you're looking for field sales and small-scale deal closing
	- If you're looking for mid-tier, go for inside sales etc.
