### Product Life-cycle
- A market can be examined into a normal distribution curve
- Rogers Diffusion of Innovation
	- Innovators
	- Early Adopters
	- Early Majority
	- Late Majority
	- Laggards
- Primarily looking at innovators, early adopters, early majority
- **We as penn students shift the curve left!** It's very dangerous to assume that we share the same distribution as everyone else

### Word of Mouth Marketing Wins
- **Word of mouth is the number one source of information referenced by buyers in high-tech markets**
- *Expectation:* Someone tells someone else, who tells even more people
- *Reality:* Lots of moving dynamics, some people are promoters, some people are detractors, and some are passives
	- Requires a lot of active cultivation

### G.A. Moore's Book
- There is a **big chasm** between the **Early Market** and the **Mainstream Pragmatists**
	- Early market visionaries (innovators, early adopters)
		- Primarily making decisions intuitively
		- Look for big changes (***revolutionary changes***)
		- Contrarian
		- Risk-takers
		- Seek the **possible**
		- Motivated by the future (*"What might be"*)
			- Real opportunity is where companies find where people *might* have a problem and solve the pain points
		- Marketing (B2B Context): Uses trade journals or trade shows
			- Focuses on general/technology oriented journals or shows
		- Focused on Technology
	- Mainstream (everyone else)
		- Focused more on analytics
		- Looking for more gradual change (***Evolutionary***)
		- Conformist
		- Risk-managers
		- Pursue the **probable**
		- Motivated by current problems
		- Marketing: Focuses on trade journals or industry shows
		- Focused on Industry

### Innovation Diffusion Interests
- **Innovators** are just trying a product just to try it
- **Early adopters** focus on competitive advantage (transforms technology into product that have value)
	- Lifeblood for high-tech startups
- **Early majority** provide significant revenue opportunity with less tolerance for risk

### To Cross the Chasm, secure a beachhead
- Focus on the target
	- Be conversant in their business
	- Industry-specific trade shows, magazines, etc.
	- Market industry-specific applications
	- Form partnerships with established channels
	- Establish trust/reputation for quality & service
- Become the obvious supplier of choice

### Key to "Crossing the Chasm" concepts
- Majority of revenue comes from the **Early and Late Majority**
- Make sure to segment
