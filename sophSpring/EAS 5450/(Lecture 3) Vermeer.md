## Questions to test intro to venture finance
1. What do all startups need to start up?
	- Cash - Needed to purchase manpower, resources, etc.
2. What are four sources of cash?
	- **Borrowing Money** - Debt/Loans
	- **Equity** - I'll give you a share of my company for cash
	- **Bootstrapping** - Hopefully the company's profits can then help you reinvest
	- **Crowdfunding** - Finding people who support your concept and give you money
3. Which is the most common (source of cash)?
	- Personal funds and bootstrapping
	- Even though VC are very hyped, its a small percentage of total companies
	- Much harder to bootstrap pharmeceuticals/high tech

## Marketing High Technology
- HP - no unified brand image or mission
- Google - Organize the world and make it accessible to everyone

**The Winning Strategy offers three critical takeaways**
1. Create products not devices
2. Establish a commanding position

### 1. Create products not devices
- Engineers invent science and technology (Devices)
- Customers buy complete products and experiences that they provide (Complete Products)
- $Devices \implies Complete \; Products$

#### What is Vermeer's initial product?
- Initial Product - Create online services
	- Easier
	- Less tech-centric
- What did they develop?
	1. Server
	2. Browser
	3. Development Tool
- The difference in the initial product descriptions is the device they developed vs. the complete product the customer wants to buy

### 2. Establish a commanding position
- A market segment shares common & unique desires, needs, buying patterns, preferences
- **Demographics are not enough** (e.g. Male, Born in 1948, Raised in the UK describe King Charles and Ozzy Osbourne)

#### What is Vermeer's *initial* target market segment?
- B2B
	- **Large** service providers
	- What is large?
	- Don't have IT/Tech "in-house" team
	- Brokerage, banks, and content providers

B. Don't attack a fortified hill
- Evaluate the industry to determine competitive dynamics (and opportunities)
- **Porter's 5 Forces**

#### How did Vermeer avoid attacking a fortified hill?
- Realized that Server and Browser components were both ruled by Microsoft, Netscape, etc.
- These companies didn't have a way to observe the third, development tool

D. Create a defensible position
- Positioning = Segmentation + **Differentiation**

#### How did Vermeer create a defensible position?
- Vermeer didn't want to make a new browser because they don't have a defensible position
- They created differentiation:

| Vermeer                                       | In-house Development                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Easy to use                                   |                                         |
| Less Expensive                                |                                         |
| $695                                          | Team: salary<br>Benefits<br>Aggravation |
| Shrink-wrapped product off-the-shelf in a box |                                         |
| WYSIWYG                                       |                                         |
| Standardized interact with others             | Proprietary                             |
| Compatibilty                                  | Special Skills Required                 |
- Need to sell a "crapload" of \$695 products to justify it as a company

E. Reposition as customer base evolves

#### Commanding position review
1. Segment market into small ponds
2. Don't attack a fortified hill
3. Focus on the segment
4. Create a defensible position
5. Reposition as customer base evolves

### 3. Adapt strategy and plan for high tech
- Over time, industries migrate from specialized to commoditized
