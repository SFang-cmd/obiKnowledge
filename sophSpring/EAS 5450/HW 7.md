### Hypothesis-Driven Entrepreneurship
- Maximizes amount of information gained for resolving uncertainty, per unit of resource expended
- Efficient exploration of all possibilities to find most effective one
- Enrepreneur develops hypothesis about business model, then tests on MVPs

#### Minimum Viable Products
- Smallest set of activities needed to disprove a hypothesis about a product
- Based on result:
	- **Persevere** with current business model
	- **Pivot** to revised model that changes some model elements while retaining others
	- **Perish** and abandon the new venture
- Once all key business model hypotheses have been validated, the startup has achieved **product-market fit**
- Helps make sure founders are offering a product that people want
- "By bounding uncertainty before scaling, the hypothesis-driven approach optimizes use of a startup's scarce resources"

#### Lean Startup
- Organizations that follow principles of hypothesis-driven entrepreneurship
- Not bootstrapping
- Just avoiding waste, still pulling funding and such
- "Time is often an entrepreneur's scarcest resource; *speed matters*"
- Make innovation faster by relying on rapid iteration, small batches, short cycle times

### Hypothesis-Driven Entrepreneurship: Process Steps
- 3 other approaches used to launch startups:
	- **Build-it-and-they-will-Come:** Relies on founder vision for initial guidance and turning it into a reality
	- **Waterfall Planning:** Divides product development into phases (design, coding, testing) that are completed in sequence by different units after a series of formal reviews
	- **Just Do It!** Figure it out as you go

#### Steps in a Lean Startup
1. Develop a Vision
	- *Ideation* is a very creative process that takes a lot of different efforts
2. Translate the Vision into Hypotheses
	- Turn it into a testable hypothesis
	- **Business Model:** Array of distinctive choices specifying a new venture's unique customer value proposition and how it will configure activities to deliver that value and earn sustainable profits.
	-  4 Elements to consider for hypothesis testing:
		- **Falsifiability:** Can be rejected through a decisive experiment (testable metrics)
			- Needs to monitor customer **conversion funnel** (step from one step of interest to next to fully loyal customer)
			- **Cohort Analysis**
		- **Comprehensiveness:** No need to have extreme detail, but should test every important aspect of the business (find potential "deal-breakers")
3. Specify MVP Tests
	- Entrepreneurs get far more reliable feedback when they put a real product in the hands of real customers
	- MVPs constraint *product functionality* or *operational capability*
		- Subset of Features
		- Or not fully rolled out to everyone
	- **Contrained Functionality:** Offer only "need to have" features, not every feature
		- Targets power users
		- Go for simplicity
	- **Constrained Operations:** Using human operators is cheaper than developing a completely new algorithm
	- **Using a Series of MVPs:** Test different things on different MVPs
	- **Constraining Customer Sets:** Try testing different customer bases but small enough that it isn't expensive
	- **False Positive and Negative Results:** Careful of False Positives
- **Concerns about MVPs** 
	- **Exposure to Idea Theft:** Generally feedback outweighs risk of rivals
		- Feedback and iterative MVP helps improve execution and time-to-market performance
	- **Reputational Risk:** Scared of making a buggy MVP, can use a different brand name or avoid name risks
4. **Prioritize Tests:**
	- Want to eliminate as much risk with as little cost as possible
	- **Parallel Testing:** test multiple MVPs at the same time; good for speed, but costly and if one test invalidates the other, then its a little "waste of time"
5. **Learn from MVP Tests**
	- Make sure it isn't a false positive or false negative
	- **Always look at users' true preferences instead of their stated preferences**
	- Avoid Cognitive Biases
	- Watch out for surprises during MVP tests:
		- **Unexpected test results:** pivot to chase where customers have the need
		- **Information not derived from testing:** Competitor releases, regulator actions, news from new tech
6. **Persevere, Pivot, or Perish**
	- **Persevere:** If the MVP validates the business model hypothesis, keep testing and finally scale
	- **Pivot:** Chase bigger opportunities
	- **Perish:** Shut down the business if it just isn't plausibly possible
7. **Scaling and Ongoing Optimization**
	- **Product-Market Fit:** The venture has the right product for the market
	- Has demand
	- Can start to scale and organize their company

### Limits to Lean Startup Methods

#### When Mistakes Must be Limited
- No post-launch ability to correct mistakes
- When mistakes could cause customers to fail mission-critical activities
	- Gmail can't lose 1% of emails
	- Dropbox cannot be out of service for a few minutes
- When there is limited societal tolerance for mistakes
	- Medical trials

#### When Demand Uncertainty is Low
- Strong unmet need means not too much unpredictability

#### When Demand Uncertainty is High but Development Cycles are Long
- Can't develop short and fast prototypes

### Dropbox
