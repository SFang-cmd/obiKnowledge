- Took the job
- Wanted to work with them, but didn't want to be the "sucker" that took the worse deal
- Take the \$120k salary, but if we're on track, we'll give you the "deferred salary" (no bonus)
- "I didn't ask for more, the cofounders asked for less than market"
	- I wasn't asking for more than them, they were asking for less than market

### Discrepancies
- Rower, not a tennis player

- Treat everyone on the same level the same or it can cause future problems
- Bioinformatcs guy, wanted a window, but it was increasingly hard to keep a window in the company for this guy

- In a company, science isn't necessarily always the most important
- **Failure on implementation is much larger than failure on invention**
- Communicate about how you think about things - "Why am I thinking about these things?"

- Fellow Garfield was actually in charge of \$3 mill of the initial \$7 mill seed funding bc it was for raw material alagos, which if handled unwell could have burned a lot of money
