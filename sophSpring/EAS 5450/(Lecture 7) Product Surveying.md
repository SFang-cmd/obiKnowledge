### Marketing that Works [BOOK]
- Spend a little time experimenting on everything
- Try to find what works

### Focus your Market Research to be Efficient & Effective
- Engage with your marketplace in two areas:
	- Customer Problem (not your product)
	- Demand Creation & Buying Process
- Two critical market research maxims
	1. Customers can relay current and known experiences "Tell me the last time you did this...", then "i can"
	2. Customers can respond and react to a concept
		- Product concept (prototype, description)
		- Advertisement, marketing message

### What customers DO is more important than what they SAY but what they SAY is better than your ASSUMPTIONS
- Most to least significant
	1. Buy product and use it
	2. Pre-order and pay

### Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a widely used survey technique
- On a score of one to ten, how likely is it that you would recommend XYZ to a friend or colleague?
	- NPS = [% Promoters] - [% Detractors]
	- Follow up with the question "Why?"
- Quick and easy way to do it

### You must build WOM into your venture; it's not magic!
- Integrate WOM in product capabilities
	- Offer something (value, service) worth talking about (positively)
	- Hotmail
		- "Get your free email at Hotmail" at the bottom of every email sent in Hotmail
