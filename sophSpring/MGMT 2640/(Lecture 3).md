## Types of Organizations
### Partnership
- General Partners - Assumes risk, but if made through a LLC, the corporation assumes all the risk; GPs personal assets are not involved
- **Special Limited Partners**: Has same liability as a GP (but usually creates a LLC to operate from; not Sammut, but "Button LLC"), so same protections as an LP

### Limited Liability Corporation (LLC)
- Combines corporate and limited partnership
- A limited partnership without the requirement of a general partner
- Used to think not a good selection for a start-up company (**Now generally considered safe**)

### Stock
- Stock represents the equity ownership of the company

#### Founder's Stock
- First step in capitalizing the start-up
	- Usually, common stock
