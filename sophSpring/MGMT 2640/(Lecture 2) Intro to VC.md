**Gatekeepers**
- Gatekeepers help divert new ventures to the VCs
- Gatekeepers:
	- If you like a VC's story, send it to us, and we'll conduct an in-depth review
	- All you have to pay is a percentage of the deal
- Some are fund of funds (decide when to invest in deals themselves)

**VC Structure**
- Problem: High fee structure
	- **Annual Feeds:** A percentage (2-3%) is going into the fund itself for operations and maintenance
	- **Capital Gains:** A 20% take on investment gain
		- ("20 points of carry")
	- 2 different Waterfalls for capital gains
		- **American Waterfall:** VCs start to take cash off the table at the start of liquidity of any company
		- **European Waterfall:** VCs only take cash from companies after the limited partners and others have recouped their investments
		- Limited Partners have reserved the right to take out from general partner capital gains if their portfolio fails
- Limited Partners hold in reserve their next round of financing
	- Some may wait until after their first round to opt in to more investments
	- Incentivizes the LPs to provide better returns
	- GPs are able to "reserve" a spot in their A round, then B round can come if it is successful
- **VCs have an extremely high tolerance for loss**
	- Typically out of ~25 companies, only a few of them will return 5, 10, 100x the money, thus turning a profit

**VC Returns**
- 30% IRR is hyped
- But reality is 15% at best
- Vast differences in VC's
	- A quarter lose funds
	- A quarter barely maintain funds
	- A quarter gain commercial bank interest
	- A quarter have 15%+ IRRs
- People who make money in VC have been in it a long time (or have made money other ways i.e. their own startups)

**Accelerator**
- Invest early on in the cycle
- Mainly adds support and resources
- Connections, some financial participation
- When figuring out participation in an accelerator
	- Make sure you understand your time commitment

**The Venture Capital Firm**
- The Firm's Legal Structure
	- Ownership: Corporate (e.g. Google Ventures)
	- Ownership: Private
		- Legal Structures
			- Partnerships (Limited Partnerships/Genneral Partners)
			- Limited Liability Corporation
			- Corporation
	- Stakeholders in a Partnership
		- General Partners (GP): Owners/Workers
		- Special Limited Partners (SPL): Individuals that have put in the money but also have some responsibility in operating the firm
		- Limited Partners (LP): Investors and the main money people
		- Advisory Board: Advises with a small fee
		- Investment Committee
- Returns and Compensation
	- SLP - pay reduced management fee; receive carried interest
	- LP - returns
- Firm's Focus
	- Stage of Investee: Seed through LBO
	- Industry Focus or Generalist
		- No proof that one does better than the other
		- Even generalists have partners that have domain expertise
	- Investment Size
	- Geographic Limit
- **Fund Vintage:** Funds formed in a specific year (Vintage 2025 funds)
- Generally funds perform best in first ever fund - sounds like survivor bias
- FAS 157: Determines the disclosures they need to make

**The J-Curve Phenomenon**
- First few years of VC fund; below water because investments have not been realized yet
- Concern for limited partners

**Classic Venture Capital Investing Process**
- Any venture funds are parallel processing many of the processes

**Generic Value Chain**
- Does not work iteratively either, discovery and due diligence and investing all occurs at the same time
